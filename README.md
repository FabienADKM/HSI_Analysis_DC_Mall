# HSI_Analysis_DC_Mall
Repo for Image classification

The purpose of this repo is to analyze some common techniques for the analysis of remote  sensing on hyperspectral images. We will analyze a hyperspectral image acquired on Washington  DC Mall a try to classify each of its pixels with a SVM classifier. To assess the performances of each methods we will have a closer look at well chosen metrics for this task
